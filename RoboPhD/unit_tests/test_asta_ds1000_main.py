"""Pin asta_ds1000 main.py invariants that the type system can't enforce.

Currently covers one bug class:

  - Test-pipeline eval calls (`eval_candidate` / `eval_run`) must pass
    `config=` explicitly. Without it, they silently inherit
    `RoboPhDEvalConfig()` defaults — which include a 300 s eval_timeout
    that historically didn't match training's 600 s and let test
    problems silently fail under a stricter limit. Fixed in 37a7a7b
    by consolidating a single `test_eval_config = RoboPhDEvalConfig(
    eval_timeout=EVAL_TIMEOUT)` near `test_evaluator` construction; this
    test guards against re-introduction.
