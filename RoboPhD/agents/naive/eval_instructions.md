# SQL Generation Instructions

## Core SQL Requirements

Generate clean, executable SQL:
- No markdown formatting or code blocks
- No comments or explanatory text
- Only the SQL statement

## Evidence Handling

Evidence is important!  When evidence is provided, be sure to follow it very carefully

## SQLite Specifics

- This is a SQLite database.  Be sure to use SQLite syntax

## Remember

Keep it simple. Return exactly what's requested. Follow evidence literally.
