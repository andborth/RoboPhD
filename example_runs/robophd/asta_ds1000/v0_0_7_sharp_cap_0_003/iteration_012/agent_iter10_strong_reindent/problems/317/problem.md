Problem:
I have a 2D list something like
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] 
and I want to convert it to a 2d numpy array. Can we do it without allocating memory like
numpy.zeros((3,3))
and then storing values to it?
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] 
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>


Write the remaining python code to append to the program above (but do not repeat the part of the code that is already given in `<code>...</code>`; just write the new code).  Put your answer inside <code> and </code> tags.
